This is a distribution of source code and data for inverse kinematics.
The inverse kinematics code is written by Yunshan Zhu, based on an 
earlier implementation by Dr. Dinesh Manocha.
The research is jointly conducted by Dr. Dinesh Manocha and Yunshan Zhu
at UNC-Chapel Hill, partially funded by NIH grant 02710.

molecular modeling research, please contact :
