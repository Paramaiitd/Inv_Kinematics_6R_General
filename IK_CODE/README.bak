This directory contains the code for inverse kinematics.

main.c 	The main program, initialize variables, and calls 
	reduce.c (24*24)
	setup.c  (?*?)   depends on the result from check_degen.c. 
	setup2.c (32*32)

degen.c is courterpart of reduce.c for the degenerated case, 
	it is called by setup.c or setup2.c


eigen1.c computes the all six angles from the result of eigenvalues.


The executable read input from stdin.
The input has the following format: (see files in ../DATA for examples)

a1 a2 ... a6
d1 d2 ... d6
alpha1 alpha2 ... alpha6

R11 R12 R13
R21 R22 R23
R31 R32 R33
T1  T2  T3


comments: R* is the rotation component of the end-effector, 
	and T* is translation part.


The output of The executable is the values of Theta1 ... Theta6.
